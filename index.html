        <p>The recipe app that allows you to create quick, nutritious meals using items you already have on-hand!
        </p>
       <h2 class = "heading"> Overview </h2>

              <h3>Objective</h3>
              <p>Most people often have food in their kitchen that they would love to cook, but they just aren’t sure what to make with it. They don’t necessarily want to go grocery shopping, and they would rather not waste money on dining out or ordering in. The issue is that they lack the inspiration or the knowledge to combine the ingredients that they have to make a quality meal. HodgePodge is designed to help its users by connecting them with recipes that are based on ingredients that they have on hand that cater to their time and skill needs. 
              </p>
          <h3> Problem Statement</h3>
          <p> We have observed that users have food that they are unsure of how to prepare, resulting in wasted food and money. Their internet searches return too many options, when they only have time and patience for one or two. As a result, people often feel overwhelmed when deciding what to cook with the food and time they have available. How might we create a platform which helps users receive limited results so they are able to save time, food and money?</p>

        After conducting extensive user research the team was able to refine our original persona. The final persona more accurately represented our ideal user. The biggest pain points of the user were food being wasted, not having enough time to cook, and not having the knowledge or skill to cook well.

  <p>I conducted 3 user tests on the low fidelity prototype. The first 2 tests revealed minor issues with the interface such as some of the touch-points being too small. Another issue that arose was that users had some difficulty navigating to the "Favorites" smoothly without coaching. 
    After the second test, I iterated on some of the screens to improve the experience during the third test. I increased the touch-point sizes where it was needed, changed some of the copy, as well as added a favorites icon to 4 of the pages to make the task of navigating to that page more intuitive. </p>
<p>During the ideation phase my teammates also created their own wireframes to represent the user flow. However, after we conducted our individual user tests, we collectively decided to proceed with my design.

 <h3>Mid-Fidelity Prototyping</h3> 
  <p>with the team I created digital wireframes using Figma. We started by mocking up the frames in simple grayscale just to get a general feel for how the app would look. 
  I created a logo for the app using Adobe Illustrate. This logo went through several iterations (see iterations below), before we decided what would work best with our app based on readability standards and overall design appearance. </p>
